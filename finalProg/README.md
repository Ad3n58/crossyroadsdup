Objective: The objective / goal of the game is to make it across the screen (vertically) and beat 3 rounds. 
           If you can cross without getting hit, you move onto the next round until you make it to the third and final round. 
           There aren't any lives being tracked so you have an infinite number of times to make it across and win :)
           You can click "play" to play the Spongebob Jellyfish Jam song to get pumped and beat the game.
           There is also a button "stop" to just stop the audio if you're bored of the song too.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to showcase our game and I hope you liked it as much as we did!

To run:
